**Step 1: Install the Apache Web Server**

1. Next, start Apache by running the following command:
```
sudo systemctl start httpd.service
```
2. Check whether the service is running by going to your serverâ€™s public IP address. The browser should display the test CentOS 7 Apache web page:

3. Finnaly, start httpd service to start at boot
```
sudo systemctl enable httpd.service
```

**Step 2: Install MariaDB and Create Database:**
1. Install MariaDB with the command:
```
sudo yum install mariadb-server mariadb
```
2. Now start MariaDB using the command:
```
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```
3. Check version of mariadb service:

**Step 4: Run MySQL Security Script**
MariaDB does not have secure settings by default. Therefore, you need to configure settings, test the database, and remove anonymous users.
```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

2. You will be prompted to provide your MariaDB root password (this is not the root password for your server). As you do not have a password yet, pressing Enter allows you to continue configuration.

3. Next, it will ask you a series of queries. To ensure your database is protected, answer the questions as follows:
- Set root password? [y/n] Y
- New password: Type in a password you would like to use
- Re-enter new password: Retype the password from the previous field
- Remove anonymous users? [y/n] Y
- Disallow root login remotely? [y/n] Y
- Remove test database and access to it? [y/n] Y
- Reload privilege tables now? [y/n] Y
